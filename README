Changes:

  - Added item drops. (health and ammo so far)
  - Added sound for item pickup.
  - Re-enabled ammo usage.
  - Added GNU Public License.
  - Added grenades.
  - Added scroll wheel support. Scrolling up scrolls the weapon selection to the left. Scrolling down scrolls the
  weapon selection to the right.
  - Fixed issue where player would retain the amount of ammo he had from a previous game after dying and restarting.
  - Added landmines.
  - Added new zombie type: the zombie dog. It moves fast and is very vicious, but very weak.
  - Added new zombie type: the acid zombie. It's slightly more durable than normal zombies, but can spit acid at you!
  - Added new zombie type: the poison fog zombie. It looks almost identical to the normal zombies with the exception
  of its slight greenish tint. They move faster than normal zombies and will explode into a cloud of poisonous gas
  when killed. This gas will poison the player, doing damage over time.
  - Added new zombie type: the zombie matron. These powerful zombies will burst if you do not kill them quickly enough,
  and when they burst, they release a swarm of 5-10 mini zombies that are faster, weaker, and smaller than normal zombies.
  Also, don't get caught in the explosion! It hurts!
  - Changed method used to spawn zombies. They still spawn continuously, but now the different types are on different
  "timers" via threads.

Known Issues:

  - Numerous concurrency issues have arisen as of late due to my multi-threading. While I am quite sure
  that they have been subdued for the moment, I would like to find a better way to handle this.
  - There are some issues to work out with the threads that handle zombie creation.

TODO:

  - Add more weapons. (Melee, etc)
  - Change gameplay so you do not start with all weapons automatically. Add store system so you can
  "buy" the weapons with your score points.
  - Change gameplay so that "waves" of zombies appear all at once. This will be temporary until
  post 1.0 release, at which point I will work on level-based gameplay.
  - Add a respawn timer for player invincibility so the player isn't immediately killed after respawning
  if there are a lot of zombies around the spawn point.

Planned Future Changes (Most likely post-1.0):
  - Add a lighting system so that you can only see directly in front of you, like a flashlight.
    (Addendum) Add a day-night cycle so you need your flashlight at night and possibly flares you can throw around.
  - Add randomly generated terrain (buildings, etc) to make combat a bit more interesting.
  - Add pathing AI to make the aforementioned terrain possible.
  - Add level-based gameplay.
  - Change enemy AI so they attack when you are in their line of sight. Also will make player give off
  "footsteps" so zombies can detect you at a certain distance. Any zombies that detect you will make
  "noise" that will attract any zombies near that zombie to attack as well, creating "hordes".
  - Create custom graphics. (least likely, considering I'm terrible at graphics work)
  - (Optional) Re-design game engine and migrate to LWJGL and Slick2D.
