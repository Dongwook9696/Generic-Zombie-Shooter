Description:

Generic Zombie Shooter is a simple overhead shooter game. Kill as many zombies as you can!
This game was being created for Halloween, but I ran into some snags that delayed the project.

Instructions:

The game is not complete, so there is limited functionality. Here are the controls.

W - Move up.
A - Move left.
S - Move down.
D - Move right.

Click/Hold Left Mouse - Shoot your primary gun. (Only one gun available so far.)

The character will rotate to face your mouse cursor. Bullets will keep traveling in the direction
you fire them until they hit a target or go out of bounds.

Changes:

- Split Canvas.java into GZSFramework and GZSCanvas.
- Optimized a few things for slightly increased performance.
- Changed zombie spawn locations. Now, they will spawn at the four sides of the screen, rather than at random locations on the screen.

Known Issues:

- Zombies are not spawning at the correct rate. The spawn counter is not working properly. It is supposed to set itself to the SPAWN_TIME constant in Globals.java to begin with, and then decrement in every cycle of the main thread. Once it reaches zero, a new zombie spawns and then it sets itself back to the SPAWN_TIME constant. The SPAWN_TIME constant is 500, but the text on screen that shows the SPAWN_TIME seems to always count down from 100, rather than 500. I have no idea where this number is coming from.

For v0.7:

- Will add scoring so you can tell how many zombies you have killed.
- Will add a delay before zombies start spawning.
- Will let the player 'die' and show a message when you die before exiting.
