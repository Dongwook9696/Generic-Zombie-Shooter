Description:

Generic Zombie Shooter is a simple overhead shooter game. Kill as many zombies as you can!

Instructions:

The game is not complete, so there is limited functionality. Here are the controls.

WASD keys - Movement
Left Click/Hold - Fire equipped weapon.
1 - Select RTPS (Rooty Tooty Point & Shooty) Assault Rifle
2 - Select Boomstick (Shotgun)
3 - Select the Flammenwerfer (Flamethrower)
4 - Select Nades (Grenades)
Mouse Scroll Wheel - Quick Select Weapon (Up = Left, Down = Right)

Your character is always facing your mouse cursor, and particles will travel in the direction you fire until
they either hit a target, or go out of bounds.

Changes:

- Added item drops. (health and ammo so far)
- Added sound for item pickup.
- Re-enabled ammo usage.
- Added GNU Public License.
- Added grenades.
- Added scroll wheel support. Scrolling up scrolls the weapon selection to the left. Scrolling down scrolls the
  weapon selection to the right.
- Fixed issue where player would retain the amount of ammo he had from a previous game after dying and restarting.

Known Issues:

- Sometimes, explosions do not "hit" zombies. (Fix submitted, but unconfirmed)
- While not a "bug", the method used for removing the black background from the explosion sprite sheet
  is inaccurate and results in a somewhat ugly explosion animation. It needs refinement.

TODO:

- Fix method for removing black background pixels from explosion sprite sheet, or find a way to remove them in Photoshop.
- Add more weapons. (Landmines, etc)
- Add new zombie types. (Fast Zombie Dogs, "Spitter"-type Zombies, Bulky Zombies that explode into
  4-5 regular zombies after a certain time interval)
- Change gameplay so that "waves" of zombies appear all at once. This will be temporary until
  post 1.0 release, at which point I will work on level-based gameplay.

Planned Future Changes (Most likely post-1.0):
- Add a lighting system so that you can only see directly in front of you, like a flashlight.
- Add randomly generated terrain (buildings, etc) to make combat a bit more interesting.
- Add pathing AI to make the aforementioned terrain possible.
- Add level-based gameplay.
- Change enemy AI so they attack when you are in their line of sight. Also will make player give off
  "footsteps" so zombies can detect you at a certain distance. Any zombies that detect you will make
  "noise" that will attract any zombies near that zombie to attack as well, creating "hordes".
- Create custom graphics. (least likely, considering I'm terrible at graphics work)
- (Optional) Re-design game engine and migrate to LWJGL and Slick2D.
