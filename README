Description:

Generic Zombie Shooter is a simple overhead shooter game. Kill as many zombies as you can!

Instructions:

The game is not complete, so there is limited functionality. Here are the controls.

WASD keys - Movement
Left Click/Hold - Fire equipped weapon.
1 - Select RTPS (Rooty Tooty Point & Shooty) Assault Rifle
2 - Select Boomstick (Shotgun)
3 - Select the Flammenwerfer (Flamethrower)

Your character is always facing your mouse cursor, and particles will travel in the direction you fire until
they either hit a target, or go out of bounds.

Changes:

- Generalized Particle class.
- Created Weapon class and re-worked how weapons are handled.
- Added AssaultRifle, Shotgun, and Flamethrower classes. These may be turned into a single class later on.
- Optimized some code.
- Increased zombie health from 20 to 250 to compensate for increase in weapon damage.
- Various graphical improvements have been made.
- Added weapons loadout to show the weapons the player has and which one is currently equipped.
- Start screen added. Simply click anywhere to start.
- Player death added. Player has three lives. When you die, you are moved back to the center of the screen.
  After losing all three lives, the game ends and the start screen re-appears.

Known Issues:

- If you switch weapons while firing the Flamethrower, the Flamethrower sound will continue to play.

TODO:

- Add grenades and more weapons.
- Add item and ammo drops and enable ammo usage.
- Change gameplay so that "waves" of zombies appear all at once. This will be temporary until
  post 1.0 release, at which point I will work on level-based gameplay.

Planned Future Changes (Most likely post-1.0):
- Add a lighting system so that you can only see directly in front of you, like a flashlight.
- Add randomly generated terrain (buildings, etc) to make combat a bit more interesting.
- Add pathing AI to make the aforementioned terrain possible.
- Add level-based gameplay.
- Change enemy AI so they attack when you are in their line of sight. Also will make player give off
  "footsteps" so zombies can detect you at a certain distance. Any zombies that detect you will make
  "noise" that will attract any zombies near that zombie to attack as well, creating "hordes".
- Create custom graphics. (least likely, considering I'm terrible at graphics work)
- (Optional) Re-design game engine and migrate to LWJGL and Slick2D.
