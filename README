Description:

Generic Zombie Shooter is a simple overhead shooter game. Kill as many zombies as you can!

Instructions:

The game is not complete, so there is limited functionality. Here are the controls.

WASD keys - Movement
Left Click/Hold - Fire equipped weapon.
1 - Select RTPS (Rooty Tooty Point & Shooty) Assault Rifle
2 - Select Boomstick (Shotgun)
3 - Select the Flammenwerfer (Flamethrower)

Your character is always facing your mouse cursor, and particles will travel in the direction you fire until
they either hit a target, or go out of bounds.

Changes:

- Generalized Particle class.
- Created Weapon class and re-worked how weapons are handled.
- Added AssaultRifle, Shotgun, and Flamethrower classes. These may be turned into a single class later on.
- Optimized some code.
- Increased zombie health from 20 to 250 to compensate for increase in weapon damage.
- Disabled sound for now. Will be re-added at a later time.

Known Issues:

- None

TODO:

- Add a GUI element for the weapons loadout so you can see what weapons you currently have,
  how much ammo they have left, and which weapon you have equipped.
- Implement player death.
- Add a start screen so you're not just thrown into the middle of a game.
- Add grenades.

Planned Future Changes (Most likely post-1.0):
- Add a lighting system so that you can only see directly in front of you, like a flashlight.
- Add randomly generated terrain (buildings, etc) to make combat a bit more interesting.
- Add pathing AI to make the aforementioned terrain possible.
- Add level-based gameplay.
- Create custom graphics. (least likely, considering I'm terrible at graphics work)
- (Optional) Re-design game engine and migrate to LWJGL and Slick2D.
