Description:

Generic Zombie Shooter is a simple overhead shooter game. Kill as many zombies as you can!

Instructions:

The game is not complete, so there is limited functionality. Here are the controls.

  WASD keys - Movement
  Mouse - Aim
  Left Click/Hold - Fire equipped weapon.
  1 - Select Rooty Tooty Point & Shooty (Assault Rifle)
  2 - Select Boomstick (Shotgun)
  3 - Select the Flammenwerfer (Flamethrower)
  4 - Select Hand Eggs (Grenades)
  5 - Select Flip-Flops (Landmines)
  Mouse Scroll Wheel - Quick Select Weapon (Up = Left, Down = Right)
  P - Pause Game
  
Zombie Types:

  - Zumby, the most basic zombie. It's the slowest of the zombies and does minimal damage. But if they swarm you,
    they can be very formidable.
  - Rotdog, a fast zombie dog that moves twice as fast as normal zombies and does 3x the damage.
  - Upchuck, a hideous hulking green zombie that spits blobs of acid at you.
  - Gasbag, a zombie that is twice as fast as normal zombies and explodes into a cloud of poisonous gas when
    killed that does poison damage over time. Grab a medkit to heal!
  - Big Mama, an ugly pale creature resembling a Wight that, if not killed fast enough, will burst into a
    swarm of tiny zombies. The burst of blood also does damage, so watch out for these!
  - Tiny Zumby, a much smaller and faster version of the Zumby, but weaker.

Changes:

  - Added ErrorWindow class. In the event of a fatal error, the program will display a screen to the user
    informing them of the error, along with the stack trace of the exception, and instructions on how to
    email the details to me so I can fix the problem.
  - Added new splash screen.
  - Added crosshair cursor.
  - Added player invincibility period for when the player respawns. This is so you don't get swarmed by zombies that
    may be lingering near the spawn point as you die. This gives you a few seconds to get away from the swarm without
    worrying about dying again. It lasts three seconds. Currently, the graphical effect is just a circle, which I
    intend to change. I may also change the effect so firing your weapon removes the effect.
  - Changed gameplay to wave based gameplay. Random zombies are created each wave. After each wave, there is a ten
    second delay before the next wave. The current wave generation method seems a little unbalanced, and needs refinement.
  - Items now spawn on timers, rather than threads to try to cut down on thread usage. They are now spawned via an
    "ItemFactory" class.
  - Added "shadows" under the player and zombies, which are basically just transparent ovals.
  - Balanced wave generation somewhat. Now, up to 25% of zombies spawned each wave can be "specials", referring
    to the Upchuck, Gasbag, and Big Mama type zombies.
  - Changed score value to cash value and changed zombie cash values to reflect this change.
  - Added text to show current wave number while a wave is in progress.
  - Added Popgun (Handgun) and added "automatic" parameter to Weapon class so non-automatic weapons will not
    continuously fire while the mouse button is held down.
  - Added player death screen showing final zombie kill count, the ending wave, how many medkits the player used,
    and how many ammo crates the player collected.

Known Issues:

  - Pausing the game during a wave countdown does not stop the countdown, and it will continue to count while paused.
    If resumed after it hits 0, it will immediately start a new wave.
  - There was one particular case of an IllegalStateException after killing a tiny zombie from a matron horde, but
    I have no been able to replicate it, and am not sure what the cause was.
  - If called from outside the framework class, the exception window seems to disappear immediately after being
    created and is replaced by a small blank window. I am thinking of making the framework variable global to solve this
    and some other issues.

TODO:

  - Add more weapons.
  - Change gameplay so you do not start with all weapons automatically. Add store system so you can
    buy the weapons with your cash.
  - Add powerups (speed, firing rate, unlimited ammo?, extra life, etc)
  - Add "boss" waves every 20 waves or so where the entire wave is just one big boss monster with a special power.
  - Add background music or ambient sounds so the game isn't as quiet. Maybe add zombie noises.
  - Add EXP and level up system to enhance certain attributes.
  - Add alt-fire for certain weapons.
  - Add effects to ammo for tertiary effects.

Planned Future Changes (Most likely post-1.0):
  - Add a lighting system so that you can only see directly in front of you, like a flashlight.
    (Addendum) Add a day-night cycle so you need your flashlight at night and possibly flares you can throw around.
  - Add randomly generated terrain (buildings, etc) to make combat a bit more interesting.
  - Add pathing AI to make the aforementioned terrain possible.
  - Add level-based gameplay.
      - Level based gameplay could revolve around a map with areas that are unexplored. Each day, you can
        choose to explore an area and fight the zombies in it and rescue survivors and do other things. You
        could travel at night, but it would be dark and there would be less visible (lighting system) and chances
        of more dangerous zombies and in larger numbers.
  - Change enemy AI so they attack when you are in their line of sight. Also will make player give off
    "footsteps" so zombies can detect you at a certain distance. Any zombies that detect you will make
    "noise" that will attract any zombies near that zombie to attack as well, creating "hordes".
  - Create custom graphics. (least likely, considering I'm terrible at graphics work)
  - (Optional) Re-design game engine and migrate to LWJGL and Slick2D.
