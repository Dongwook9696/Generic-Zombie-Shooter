Changes:

  - Added ErrorWindow class. In the event of a fatal error, the program will display a screen to the user
  informing them of the error, along with the stack trace of the exception, and instructions on how to
  email the details to me so I can fix the problem.
  - Added new splash screen.
  - Added crosshair cursor.
  - Added player invincibility period for when the player respawns. This is so you don't get swarmed by zombies that
  may be lingering near the spawn point as you die. This gives you a few seconds to get away from the swarm without
  worrying about dying again. It lasts three seconds. Currently, the graphical effect is just a circle, which I
  intend to change. I may also change the effect so firing your weapon removes the effect.
  - Changed gameplay to wave based gameplay. Random zombies are created each wave. After each wave, there is a ten
  second delay before the next wave. The current wave generation method seems a little unbalanced, and needs refinement.
  - Items now spawn on timers, rather than threads to try to cut down on thread usage. They are now spawned via an
  "ItemFactory" class.

Known Issues:

  - Pausing the game during a wave countdown does not stop the countdown, and it will continue to count while paused.
  If resumed after it hits 0, it will immediately start a new wave.
  - There was one particular case of an IllegalStateException after killing a tiny zombie from a matron horde, but
  I have no been able to replicate it, and am not sure what the cause was.
  - If called from outside the framework class, the exception window seems to disappear immediately after being
  created and is replaced by a small blank window. I am thinking of making the framework variable global to solve this
  and some other issues.

TODO:

  - Add more weapons. (Melee, etc)
  - Change gameplay so you do not start with all weapons automatically. Add store system so you can
  "buy" the weapons with your score points.
  - Balance wave generation.
  - Add powerups (speed, firing rate, unlimited ammo?, extra life, etc)
  - Add "boss" waves every 20 waves or so where the entire wave is just one big boss monster with a special power.
  - Add background music or ambient sounds so the game isn't as quiet. Maybe add zombie noises.
  - Add end screen showing final zombie kill count after player dies.

Planned Future Changes (Most likely post-1.0):
  - Add a lighting system so that you can only see directly in front of you, like a flashlight.
    (Addendum) Add a day-night cycle so you need your flashlight at night and possibly flares you can throw around.
  - Add randomly generated terrain (buildings, etc) to make combat a bit more interesting.
  - Add pathing AI to make the aforementioned terrain possible.
  - Add level-based gameplay.
      - Level based gameplay could revolve around a map with areas that are unexplored. Each day, you can
      choose to explore an area and fight the zombies in it and rescue survivors and do other things. You
      could travel at night, but it would be dark and there would be less visible (lighting system) and chances
      of more dangerous zombies and in larger numbers.
  - Change enemy AI so they attack when you are in their line of sight. Also will make player give off
  "footsteps" so zombies can detect you at a certain distance. Any zombies that detect you will make
  "noise" that will attract any zombies near that zombie to attack as well, creating "hordes".
  - Create custom graphics. (least likely, considering I'm terrible at graphics work)
  - (Optional) Re-design game engine and migrate to LWJGL and Slick2D.
