Description:

Generic Zombie Shooter is a simple overhead shooter game. Kill as many zombies as you can!

Instructions:

The game is not complete, so there is limited functionality. Here are the controls.

  Mouse - Aim
  Left Click/Hold - Fire equipped weapon.
  1 - Select Popgun (Handgun)

Zombie Types:

  - Zumby, the most basic zombie. It's the slowest of the zombies and does minimal damage. But if they swarm you,
    they can be very formidable.
  - Rotdog, a fast zombie dog that moves twice as fast as normal zombies and does 3x the damage.
  - Upchuck, a hideous hulking green zombie that spits blobs of acid at you.
  - Gasbag, a zombie that is twice as fast as normal zombies and explodes into a cloud of poisonous gas when
    killed that does poison damage over time. Grab a medkit to heal!
  - Big Mama, an ugly pale creature resembling a Wight that, if not killed fast enough, will burst into a
    swarm of tiny zombies. The burst of blood also does damage, so watch out for these!
  - Tiny Zumby, a much smaller and faster version of the Zumby, but weaker.

Changes:

  - Added weapons store and changed player to only start with the Handgun. The store allows the player to purchase
    weapons and ammo. Ammo crates still spawn as per usual. All weapon and ammo prices set to 0 for testing purposes.

Known Issues:

  - Pausing the game during a wave countdown does not stop the countdown, and it will continue to count while paused.
    If resumed after it hits 0, it will immediately start a new wave.
  - There was one particular case of an IllegalStateException after killing a tiny zombie from a matron horde, but
    I have no been able to replicate it, and am not sure what the cause was.
  - If called from outside the framework class, the exception window seems to disappear immediately after being
    created and is replaced by a small blank window. I am thinking of making the framework variable global to solve this
    and some other issues.
  - If the user clicks fast enough past the death and title screens to a new game, all the items dropped in the previous
    game will still be on the field, and all ammo values will be retained from the previous game, even if you haven't
    purchased the weapon yet.

TODO:

  - Add powerups (speed, firing rate, unlimited ammo?, extra life, etc)
  - Add "boss" waves every 20 waves or so where the entire wave is just one big boss monster with a special power.
  - Add background music or ambient sounds so the game isn't as quiet. Maybe add zombie noises.
  - Add EXP and level up system to enhance certain attributes.
  - Add alt-fire for certain weapons.
  - Add effects to ammo for tertiary effects.
  - Add message system to display various information.
  - Add transparent overlay for weapons loadout weapons to show remaining cooldown on that weapon.

Planned Future Changes (Most likely post-1.0):
  - Add a lighting system so that you can only see directly in front of you, like a flashlight.
    (Addendum) Add a day-night cycle so you need your flashlight at night and possibly flares you can throw around.
  - Add randomly generated terrain (buildings, etc) to make combat a bit more interesting.
  - Add pathing AI to make the aforementioned terrain possible.
  - Add level-based gameplay.
      - Level based gameplay could revolve around a map with areas that are unexplored. Each day, you can
        choose to explore an area and fight the zombies in it and rescue survivors and do other things. You
        could travel at night, but it would be dark and there would be less visible (lighting system) and chances
        of more dangerous zombies and in larger numbers.
  - Change enemy AI so they attack when you are in their line of sight. Also will make player give off
    "footsteps" so zombies can detect you at a certain distance. Any zombies that detect you will make
    "noise" that will attract any zombies near that zombie to attack as well, creating "hordes".
  - Create custom graphics. (least likely, considering I'm terrible at graphics work)
  - (Optional) Re-design game engine and migrate to LWJGL and Slick2D.
