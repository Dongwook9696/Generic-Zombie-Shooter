Description:

Generic Zombie Shooter is a simple overhead shooter game. Kill as many zombies as you can!

Instructions:

The game is not complete, so there is limited functionality. Here are the controls.

WASD keys - Movement
Left Click/Hold - Fire equipped weapon.
1 - Select RTPS (Rooty Tooty Point & Shooty) Assault Rifle
2 - Select Boomstick (Shotgun)
3 - Select the Flammenwerfer (Flamethrower)

Your character is always facing your mouse cursor, and particles will travel in the direction you fire until
they either hit a target, or go out of bounds.

Changes:

- Added item drops. (health and ammo so far)
- Added sound for item pickup.
- Re-enabled ammo usage.
- Added GNU Public License.

Known Issues:

- If you switch weapons while firing the Flamethrower, the Flamethrower sound will continue to play.
- The player retains his ammo values from a previous game if he returns to the start screen after death.

TODO:

- Add grenades and more weapons.
- Change gameplay so that "waves" of zombies appear all at once. This will be temporary until
  post 1.0 release, at which point I will work on level-based gameplay.

Planned Future Changes (Most likely post-1.0):
- Add a lighting system so that you can only see directly in front of you, like a flashlight.
- Add randomly generated terrain (buildings, etc) to make combat a bit more interesting.
- Add pathing AI to make the aforementioned terrain possible.
- Add level-based gameplay.
- Change enemy AI so they attack when you are in their line of sight. Also will make player give off
  "footsteps" so zombies can detect you at a certain distance. Any zombies that detect you will make
  "noise" that will attract any zombies near that zombie to attack as well, creating "hordes".
- Create custom graphics. (least likely, considering I'm terrible at graphics work)
- (Optional) Re-design game engine and migrate to LWJGL and Slick2D.
