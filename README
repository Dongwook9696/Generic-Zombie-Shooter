Changes:

  - Added ErrorWindow class. In the event of a fatal error, the program will display a screen to the user
  informing them of the error, along with the stack trace of the exception, and instructions on how to
  email the details to me so I can fix the problem.
  - Added new splash screen.
  - Added crosshair cursor.
  - Added player invincibility period for when the player respawns. This is so you don't get swarmed by zombies that
  may be lingering near the spawn point as you die. This gives you a few seconds to get away from the swarm without
  worrying about dying again. It lasts three seconds. Currently, the graphical effect is just a circle, which I
  intend to change. I may also change the effect so firing your weapon removes the effect.
  - Added Wave class, which will be used to store zombies. Each wave, a new zombie set will be added to it and the
  update() method will be called on the wave to update all zombies.

Known Issues:

  - Due in part to the migration from continuous spawning to wave based gameplay, somewhere along the way, I managed
  to break something, and now poison fog zombie explosions don't always show in the right spot. I have to assume
  this is caused by me passing a reference to a Point object, rather than a new Point object somewhere, but I'm not sure.
  I am not sure if this is the case for zombie Matrons as well.
  - Pausing the game during a wave countdown does not stop the countdown, and it will continue to count while paused.
  If resumed after it hits 0, it will immediately start a new wave.
  - There was one particular case of an IllegalStateException after killing a tiny zombie from a matron horde, but
  I have no been able to replicate it, and am not sure what the cause was.
  - If called from outside the framework class, the exception window seems to disappear immediately after being
  created and is replaced by a small blank window. I am thinking of making the framework variable global to solve this
  and some other issues.

TODO:

  - Add more weapons. (Melee, etc)
  - Change gameplay so you do not start with all weapons automatically. Add store system so you can
  "buy" the weapons with your score points.
  - Change gameplay so that "waves" of zombies appear all at once. This will be temporary until
  post 1.0 release, at which point I will work on level-based gameplay.

Planned Future Changes (Most likely post-1.0):
  - Add a lighting system so that you can only see directly in front of you, like a flashlight.
    (Addendum) Add a day-night cycle so you need your flashlight at night and possibly flares you can throw around.
  - Add randomly generated terrain (buildings, etc) to make combat a bit more interesting.
  - Add pathing AI to make the aforementioned terrain possible.
  - Add level-based gameplay.
      - Level based gameplay could revolve around a map with areas that are unexplored. Each day, you can
      choose to explore an area and fight the zombies in it and rescue survivors and do other things. You
      could travel at night, but it would be dark and there would be less visible (lighting system) and chances
      of more dangerous zombies and in larger numbers.
  - Change enemy AI so they attack when you are in their line of sight. Also will make player give off
  "footsteps" so zombies can detect you at a certain distance. Any zombies that detect you will make
  "noise" that will attract any zombies near that zombie to attack as well, creating "hordes".
  - Create custom graphics. (least likely, considering I'm terrible at graphics work)
  - (Optional) Re-design game engine and migrate to LWJGL and Slick2D.
