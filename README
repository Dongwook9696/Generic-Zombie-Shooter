Zombie Types:

  - Zumby, the most basic zombie. It's the slowest of the zombies and does minimal damage. But if they swarm you,
    they can be very formidable.
  - Rotdog, a fast zombie dog that moves twice as fast as normal zombies and does 3x the damage.
  - Upchuck, a hideous hulking green zombie that spits blobs of acid at you.
  - Gasbag, a zombie that is twice as fast as normal zombies and explodes into a cloud of poisonous gas when
    killed that does poison damage over time. Grab a medkit to heal!
  - Big Mama, an ugly pale creature resembling a Wight that, if not killed fast enough, will burst into a
    swarm of tiny zombies. The burst of blood also does damage, so watch out for these!
  - Tiny Zumby, a much smaller and faster version of the Zumby, but weaker.
  
Items:

  - Health Pack, heals the player and removes the poison effect.
  - Ammo Crate, gives the player some ammo for a random weapon. These may be removed/changed soon.
  - SpeedUp, doubles the player's movement speed for 10 seconds.
  - Unlimited Ammo, stops ammo consumption for the Assault Rifle, Shotgun, and Flamethrower for 10 seconds.
  - Extra Life, gives the player 1 extra life.

Changes:

  - Added weapons store and changed player to only start with the Handgun. The store allows the player to purchase
    weapons and ammo. Ammo crates still spawn as per usual. All weapon and ammo prices set to 0 for testing purposes.
  - Added translucent overlay to weapon icons to show remaining cooldown on that weapon. Shrinks from right to left.
  - Added three power-up items; the SpeedUp, which doubles the player's movement speed for 10 seconds, the Unlimited
    Ammo power-up, which stops ammo consumption for the Assault Rifle, Shotgun, and Flamethrower for 10 seconds,
    and the Extra Life power-up, which.... gives the player an extra life, and the Experience Multiplier power-up,
    which doubles the player's experience for 20 seconds!
  - Changed invulnerability effect for when player dies to a "blink" effect, rather than the white circle used previously.
  - Added expiration times for items so health packs, ammo, power-ups, etc will disappear from the screen after
    a set duration.
  - Added status effect icon display under upper HUD to show status effects currently affecting the player.
  - Status effect icons now "fade out" when within 3 seconds of their expiration time.
  - Added message system to show helpful information about power-ups you collect above the weapons loadout.
  - Modified items to now blink when they are close to the time they are set to expire.
  - Added basic experience / leveling system with skill points. All skills max out at 5. Each level in health
    increments your maximum health by 50. Each level in damage increases your damage bonus by 20%, and each level
    in speed increases your speed bonus by 20%. The experience / leveling screen shows your current level in each skill.

Known Issues:

  - Pausing the game during a wave countdown does not stop the countdown, and it will continue to count while paused.
    If resumed after it hits 0, it will immediately start a new wave.
  - There was one particular case of an IllegalStateException after killing a tiny zombie from a matron horde, but
    I have no been able to replicate it, and am not sure what the cause was.

TODO:

  - Add more power-ups?
  - Add "boss" waves every 20 waves or so where the entire wave is just one big boss monster with a special power.
  - Add background music or ambient sounds so the game isn't as quiet. Maybe add zombie noises.
  - Add alt-fire for certain weapons.
  - Add effects to ammo for tertiary effects.
  - Enhance visuals of weapons store.

Planned Future Changes (Most likely post-1.0):
  - Add a lighting system so that you can only see directly in front of you, like a flashlight.
    (Addendum) Add a day-night cycle so you need your flashlight at night and possibly flares you can throw around.
  - Add randomly generated terrain (buildings, etc) to make combat a bit more interesting.
  - Add pathing AI to make the aforementioned terrain possible.
  - Add level-based gameplay.
      - Level based gameplay could revolve around a map with areas that are unexplored. Each day, you can
        choose to explore an area and fight the zombies in it and rescue survivors and do other things. You
        could travel at night, but it would be dark and there would be less visible (lighting system) and chances
        of more dangerous zombies and in larger numbers.
  - Change enemy AI so they attack when you are in their line of sight. Also will make player give off
    "footsteps" so zombies can detect you at a certain distance. Any zombies that detect you will make
    "noise" that will attract any zombies near that zombie to attack as well, creating "hordes".
  - Create custom graphics. (least likely, considering I'm terrible at graphics work)
  - (Optional) Re-design game engine and migrate to LWJGL and Slick2D.
