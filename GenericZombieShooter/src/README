Description:

Generic Zombie Shooter is a simple overhead shooter game. Kill as many zombies as you can!
This game was being created for Halloween, but I ran into some snags that delayed the project.

Instructions:

The game is not complete, so there is limited functionality. Here are the controls.

W - Move up.
A - Move left.
S - Move down.
D - Move right.

Click/Hold Left Mouse - Shoot your primary gun. (Only one gun available so far.)

The character will rotate to face your mouse cursor. Bullets will keep traveling in the direction
you fire them until they hit a target or go out of bounds.

Changes:

- Changed to JDK 1.6
- Fixed Github repository.

Known Issues:

- None

For v0.7:

- Will add scoring so you can tell how many zombies you have killed.
- Will add a delay before zombies start spawning.
- Will let the player 'die' and show a message when you die before exiting.
